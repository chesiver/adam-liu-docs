## Streams

Bash receives input and sends output as sequences or **streams** of characters. These streams may be redirected into files or one into another.

There are three descriptors:

| Code | Descriptor | Description          |
| :--: | :--------: | :------------------- |
| `0`  |  `stdin`   | The standard input.  |
| `1`  |  `stdout`  | The standard output. |
| `2`  |  `stderr`  | The errors output.   |

Redirection makes it possible to control where the output of a command goes to, and where the input of a command comes from. For redirecting streams these operators are used:

| Operator | Description                                                          |
| :------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `>`    | Redirecting output                                                   |
|   `&>`   | Redirecting output and error output                                  |
|  `&>>`   | Appending redirected output and error output                         |
|   `<`    | Redirecting input                                                    |
|   `<<`   | [Here documents](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html) syntax |
|  `<<<`   | [Here strings](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/x17837.html)         |

```bash
# output of ls will be written to list.txt
ls -l > list.txt

# append output to list.txt
ls -a >> list.txt

# all errors will be written to errors.txt
grep da * 2> errors.txt

# read from errors.txt
less < errors.txt
```

## Pipes

We could redirect standard streams not only in files, but also to other programs. **Pipes** let us use the output of a program as the input of another.

In the example below, `command1` sends its output to `command2`, which then passes it on to the input of `command3`:

```
command1 | command2 | command3
```

Constructions like this are called **pipelines**.

In practice, this can be used to process data through several programs. For example, here the output of `ls -l` is sent to the `grep` program, which prints only files with a `.md` extension, and this output is finally sent to the `less` program:

```bash
ls -l | grep .md$ | less
```

The exit status of a pipeline is normally the exit status of the last command in the pipeline. The shell will not return a status until all the commands in the pipeline have completed. If you want your pipelines to be considered a failure if any of the commands in the pipeline fail, you should set the pipefail option with:

```bash
set -o pipefail
```
