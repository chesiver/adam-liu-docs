### Menger curvature

Generally we learned formal definition of curvature of parametric curve in calculus courses. But in programming we only need a much
simpler equation defined for a triangle.

### Centripetal Catmullâ€“Rom spline

Given a set of points, we may want to create a smooth curve that goes through these points.
