## About Dependency Injection

#### Use DI Widely as Java Boy

Since I started my career at Oracle and moved to Amazon, I became mostly familar with Java.
In AWS, a lightweight depenedency injection framework https://github.com/google/dagger was heavily used. At that time
I noticed many of my teammates somehow abused its usage and injected some dependencies which were better organized
as global singletons.

#### Gophers dislike DI Library

In Bytedance, most services are written in golang and things become completely opposite. Denpendencies are 
mostly defined as global variable and initialized in init() function.

This caused serious problems when writing unit tests. If one dependenciy is global, then one can only create one corresponding 
global mock object. Then imaging we have a 2 concurrently running tests which need different behaviors of this mock...  

#### Manually Do DI

DI libraries are indeed too heavy for golang. But DI is still important if we want to have inverse-of-control, also to 
facilitate writing unit tests. So currently when coding in golang, I prefer to do DI manually.

## Mock in golang

First of all, an important thing to bear in mind is that 

**You can only mock interfaces in golang. Better not to mock structs.**

There are some libraries like https://github.com/agiledragon/gomonkey which modifies compiled go program
but that could be tricky and won't work on some cpu architecture: https://github.com/agiledragon/gomonkey/issues/70

### Use of [GoMock](https://github.com/golang/mock)

#### Install

```bash copy
go install github.com/golang/mock/mockgen@v1.6.0
```

```bash copy
go get github.com/golang/mock/gomock
```

#### Generating Mocks

https://github.com/chesiver/gomock-playground

```bash
mockgen -source clients/client.go -destination mocks/client.go
```

Then we can create mock client when running test. 

To use mock, we must create a controller which is responsible for tracking and asserting 
the expectations of its associated mock objects.

```go
func InvokeClient(client clients.Client) {
	client.GetData()
}
```

```go
func TestInvokeClient(t *testing.T) {
	ctrl := gomock.NewController(t)
	mockClient := mock_clients.NewMockClient(ctrl)
	mockClient.EXPECT().GetData().Times(1)
	InvokeClient(mockClient)
}
```
