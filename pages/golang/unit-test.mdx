## About Dependency Injection

#### Use DI Widely as Java Boy

Since I started my career at Oracle and moved to Amazon, I became mostly familar with Java.
In AWS, a lightweight depenedency injection framework https://github.com/google/dagger was heavily used. At that time
I noticed many of my teammates somehow abused its usage and injected some dependencies which were better organized
as global singletons.

#### Gophers dislike DI Library

In Bytedance, most services are wirtte in golang and things become completely opposite. Denpendencies are 
mostly defined as global variable and initialized in init() function.

This caused serious problems when writing unit test. If one dependenciy is global, one can only create one corresponding 
mock object for it. Imaging we have a 2 concurrently running tests which need different behaviors of this mock...  

#### Manually Do DI

DI libraries do seem a little bit heavy for golan. But DI is still important if we want to have inverse-of-control to 
facilitate writing unit tests. So currently I'm more inclined to do DI manually.
