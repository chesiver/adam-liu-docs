## Method Declaration

https://go.dev/ref/spec#Method_declarations

> A method is a function with a **receiver**. A method declaration binds an identifier, the method name, to a method, 
and associates the method with the receiver's base type.

### When to Use Value Receiver

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27775376/value-receiver-vs-pointer-receiver

https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#receiver-type

- If the receiver is a **map, func or chan**, don't use a pointer to them. 
- If the receiver is **a slice and the method doesn't reslice or reallocate the slice**, don't use a pointer to it.
- If the method needs to **mutate** the receiver, the receiver must be a pointer.
- If the receiver is a struct that contains a **sync.Mutex or similar synchronizing field**, the receiver must be a pointer to avoid copying.
- If the receiver is a **large struct or array**, a pointer receiver is more efficient. How large is large? Assume it's equivalent to passing all its elements as arguments to the method.
If that feels too large, it's also too large for the receiver.
- Can function or methods, either concurrently or when called from this method, be mutating the receiver? A value type creates a copy of the receiver when the method is invoked,
so outside updates will not be applied to this receiver. If changes must be visible in the original receiver, the receiver must be a pointer.
- If the receiver is a struct, array or slice and any of its elements is a pointer to something that might be mutating, prefer a pointer receiver, 
as it will make the intention clearer to the reader.
- If the receiver is a **small array or struct that is naturally a value type** (for instance, something like the time.Time type), with no mutable fields and no pointers, 
or is just a simple basic type such as int or string, a value receiver makes sense. A value receiver can reduce the amount of garbage that can be generated; 
if a value is passed to a value method, an on-stack copy can be used instead of allocating on the heap. (The compiler tries to be smart about avoiding this allocation, but it can't always succeed.) Don't choose a value receiver type for this reason without profiling first.
- **Don't mix receiver types**. Choose either pointers or struct types for all available methods.
- Finally, when in doubt, use a pointer receiver.


**Both value receiver and pointer receiver methods can be invoked on a correctly-typed pointer or non-pointer**.

Regardless of what the method is called on, within the method body the identifier of the receiver refers to a by-copy value when a value receiver is used, 
and a pointer when a pointer receiver is used: [Example](https://go.dev/play/p/3WHGaAbURM)

### Method Sets (Pointer vs Value Receiver)

https://go.dev/ref/spec#Method_sets

> - The method set of a defined type T consists of all methods declared with receiver type T.
> - The method set of a pointer to a defined type T (where T is neither a pointer nor an interface) is the set of all methods declared with receiver *T or T.
> - The method set of an interface type is the intersection of the method sets of each type in the interface's type set (the resulting method set is usually just the set of declared methods in the interface).

If you have a T and it is addressable you can call methods that have a receiver type of *T as well as methods that have a receiver type of T, 
because **the method call t.Meth() will be equivalent to (&t).Meth()**.

If you have an interface I, and some or all of the methods in I's method set are provided by methods with a receiver of *T 
(with the remainder being provided by methods with a receiver of T), then ***T satisfies the interface I, but T doesn't**. 
That is because *T's method set includes T's, but not the other way around (back to the first point again).

[Example](https://go.dev/play/p/cScTYeTQo-c)
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type A struct{}

func (a A) TestMethod1() {
	fmt.Println("TestMethod1")
}

func (a *A) TestMethod2() {
	fmt.Println("TestMethod2")
}

type B struct {
	A
}

type C struct {
	*A
}

type D interface {
	TestMethod1()
	TestMethod2()
}

func main() {
	b, c := B{A{}}, C{&A{}}
	b.TestMethod1()
	b.TestMethod2() // This actually works. But it is a shorthand for(&b.A).TestMethod2()
	c.TestMethod1()
	c.TestMethod2()
	// var d1 D = b // This does't work.
	var d2 D = c
	fmt.Println(d2)
}
```

You can mix and match methods with value receivers and methods with pointer receivers, and use them with variables containing values and pointers, 
without worrying about which is which. Both will work, and the syntax is the same. However, if methods with pointer receivers are needed to satisfy an interface, 
then only a pointer will be assignable to the interface â€” a value won't be valid

### Value Copy for Value Receiver

> Calling value receiver methods through interfaces always creates extra copies of your values.

[Example](https://go.dev/play/p/RzQMOMW-1I3)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type A struct {
	Val int
}

func (a *A) TestMethod1() {
	fmt.Println("TestMethod1")
}

func (a A) TestMethod2() {
	fmt.Println("TestMethod2")
	fmt.Println("Address in method: " + fmt.Sprintf("%p", &a.Val))
}

type I interface {
	TestMethod2()
}

func main() {
	a := &A{Val: 1}
	fmt.Println("Address before method: " + fmt.Sprintf("%p", &a.Val))
	var b I = a
	b.TestMethod2()
}

```
