## Embedding

https://go.dev/ref/spec#Struct_types

> A field declared with a type but no explicit field name is called an embedded field. An embedded field must be specified as a type name T 
or as a pointer to a non-interface type name *T, and T itself may not be a pointer type. The unqualified type name acts as the field name.

```go
// A struct with four embedded fields of types T1, *T2, P.T3 and *P.T4
struct {
	T1        // field name is T1
	*T2       // field name is T2
	P.T3      // field name is T3
	*P.T4     // field name is T4
	x, y int  // field names are x and y
}
```

```go
struct {
	T     // conflicts with embedded field *T and *P.T
	*T    // conflicts with embedded field T and *P.T
	*P.T  // conflicts with embedded field T and *T
}
```

### Promoted Field / Method

> A field or method f of an embedded field in a struct x is called promoted if x.f is a legal selector that denotes that field or method f.

> Promoted fields act like ordinary fields of a struct **except that they cannot be used as field names in composite literals of the struct**.

[Example](https://go.dev/play/p/gZO3I-uZtC9)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type A struct {
	Val int
}

type B struct {
	A
}

func main() {
	// b := B{Val: 1} // this doesn't work
	b := B{A{Val: 1}}
	fmt.Printf("%+v\n", b)
}

```

### Method Sets

> Given a struct type S and a named type T, promoted methods are included in the method set of the struct as follows:
> - If S contains an embedded field T, the method sets of S and *S both include promoted methods with receiver T. 
The method set of *S also includes promoted methods with receiver *T.
> - If S contains an embedded field *T, the method sets of S and *S both include promoted methods with receiver T or *T.

[Example](https://go.dev/play/p/48xsm2wenbz)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type A struct{}

func (a A) TestMethod1() {
	fmt.Println("TestMethod1")
}

func (a *A) TestMethod2() {
	fmt.Println("TestMethod2")
}

type B struct {
	A
}

type C struct {
	*A
}

func main() {
	b, c := B{A{}}, C{&A{}}
	b.TestMethod1()
	b.TestMethod2() /** 
        This actually works. But it is a shorthand for(&b.A).TestMethod2(). 
        However, B's method set doesn't include TestMethod2
    */
	c.TestMethod1()
	c.TestMethod2()
}

```
