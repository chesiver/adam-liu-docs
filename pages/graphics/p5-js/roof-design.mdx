#### 1. isInDiskOnRight(Q, A, B, r): in disk test for edge(A, B)

Test where query point Q lies inside the disk of radius r that is tangent to A and B and that has its center to the right 
of the oriented Line(A, B).

#### 2. drawDarts(r): draw darts of alpha complex

Assume that $P=\{P_{i}\}^{n}$ is a set of n points. Let $Dart(A,B)$ be the oriented **sidewalk** on the right if $Edge(A,B)$
oriented from A to B. We say that $Dart(B,A)$ is opposite of $Dart(A,B)$ and vice versa.  $Dart(A,B)$ is **exposed** 
when the open disk of radius r that has a center on the right of the oriented $Line(A,B)$ and is tangent 
to A and B contains no point.

A dart is colored red is it's exposed and green otherwise. Don't draw green/green pairs.

#### 3. Define the faces

Let d denote a dart, v denote a vertex. The Darts define red and green loops. The set of darts defines an alpha complex
S, which may have an empty interior and a set of dangling edges. 

- d.e returns true when dart is exposed(red)
- d.v is the index of start vertex of d
- v.d is a dart such that v === d.v
- d.s and d.u respectively return the next (swing) and previous (unswing) dart in a clockwise ordering of all darts 
that have d.v as as starting vertex

We define a face F as a topologically open pointset so that $F=iF$


#### 4. Concise DES representation

The DES representation proposed there stores the geometry of the alpha-complext in the G[] array, where G[v] 
is the location of vertex v, and only 3 arrays: D, E and S: D[v] stores v.d, E[d] stores d.e. When S[d] > 0,
it stores d.s, otherwise it stores -d.v-1

So, starting with a vertex ID v, we can access a dart d=D[v]. Then if we iterate d=d.s, we swing around v and visit in
a clockwise order all the darts that start at v.

#### 5. Non-Manifold vertices

Detect non-manifold vertices of the closure of iS and decides whether they are bounding in a single face.

#### 6. test clockwise order of three vectors

Given a sorted list of three vectors, (U,V,W) establishes whether their orientations are sorted clockwise.

#### 7. InsertInSwingRing

Given a vertex v and a dart d such that d.v == v, insert dart d in the swing ring of v in the right place, 
so as to respect the clockwise ordering.

#### 8.Comput the D&S array

Initialize the swing rings heads D[v] to point to themselves: D[v]=-v-1; Insert the darts into the appropriate 
swingRings.  */}
