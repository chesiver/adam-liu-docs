## Graph Visulziation

> Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. 
> Automatic graph drawing has many important applications in software engineering, database and web design, networking, 
> and in visual interfaces for many other domains.


### Graphviz

Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Although it's written in C, many people already ported it by WASM and thus can be used in 
browser environemt.

Eg. Dot code
```
digraph G {

	subgraph cluster_0 {
		style=filled;
		color=lightgrey;
		node [style=filled,color=white];
		a0 -> a1 -> a2 -> a3;
		label = "process #1";
	}

	subgraph cluster_1 {
		node [style=filled];
		b0 -> b1 -> b2 -> b3;
		label = "process #2";
		color=blue
	}
	start -> a0;
	start -> b0;
	a1 -> b3;
	b2 -> a3;
	a3 -> a0;
	a3 -> end;
	b3 -> end;

	start [shape=Mdiamond];
	end [shape=Msquare];
}

```

Rendered as

```dot
digraph G {

	subgraph cluster_0 {
		style=filled;
		color=lightgrey;
		node [style=filled,color=white];
		a0 -> a1 -> a2 -> a3;
		label = "process #1";
	}

	subgraph cluster_1 {
		node [style=filled];
		b0 -> b1 -> b2 -> b3;
		label = "process #2";
		color=blue
	}
	start -> a0;
	start -> b0;
	a1 -> b3;
	b2 -> a3;
	a3 -> a0;
	a3 -> end;
	b3 -> end;

	start [shape=Mdiamond];
	end [shape=Msquare];
}

    Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me?
    John-->>-Alice: Hi Alice, I can hear you!
    John-->>-Alice: I feel great!
```
