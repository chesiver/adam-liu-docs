- Red - u
- Green - v (**up**)
- Blue - n

> Specify the location of the camera

> Specify a location the camera is looking at. This value can be any point that is in front of the camera along 
it's line-of-sight. It's exact location along the line-of-sight does not matter. 
This point defines the direction of the **-n** axis 

> Specify the general direction of “up” for the camera. The cross product of this vector and the negation of the 
line-of-sight vector will produce the u axis of the camera's coordinate system.

### OrbitControls

https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls

import FullscreenThreejs from 'components/fullscreenThreejs'
import OrbitControlsExample from 'threejs/orbit-controls'

<FullscreenThreejs render={OrbitControlsExample}/>

### TrackballControls

https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/TrackballControls

import TrackballControlsExample from 'threejs/trackball-controls'

<FullscreenThreejs render={TrackballControlsExample}/>

### Difference between Orbit and Trackball Control

TrackballControls is similar to OrbitControls. However, it does not maintain a constant camera up vector. 
That means if the camera orbits over the “north” and “south” poles, it does not flip.
