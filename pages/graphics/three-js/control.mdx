- Red - u
- Green - v (**up**)
- Blue - n

> Specify the location of the camera

> Specify a location the camera is looking at. This value can be any point that is in front of the camera along 
it's line-of-sight. It's exact location along the line-of-sight does not matter. 
This point defines the direction of the **-n** axis 

> Specify the general direction of “up” for the camera. The cross product of this vector and the negation of the 
line-of-sight vector will produce the u axis of the camera's coordinate system.

## Control

### OrbitControls

https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls

import FullscreenThreejs from 'components/fullscreenThreejs'
import OrbitControlsExample from 'threejs/orbit-controls'

<FullscreenThreejs render={OrbitControlsExample}/>

### TrackballControls

https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/TrackballControls

import TrackballControlsExample from 'threejs/trackball-controls'

<FullscreenThreejs render={TrackballControlsExample}/>

### Difference between Orbit and Trackball Control

TrackballControls is similar to OrbitControls. However, it does not maintain a constant camera **up vector**.

That means if the camera orbits over the “north” and “south” poles, it does not **flip**. This is why 
https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls.maxPolarAngle 's Range is 0 to Math.PI radians.


### PointLockControls

https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/PointerLockControls

> PointerLockControls is a perfect choice for first person 3D games

#### Ray Tracing
In this example, to detect if the first person stands on a box, https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Raycaster
is used.

```typescript
raycaster = new Raycaster(new Vector3(), new Vector3(0, -1, 0), 0, 10); // a ray points to -y (downward)
```

```typescript
raycaster.ray.origin.copy(controls.getObject().position);
raycaster.ray.origin.y -= 10;
const intersections = raycaster.intersectObjects(objects, false);
const onObject = intersections.length > 0;
```

#### Indexed Geometry vs Non-indexed Geometry

Non-indexed geometry presents every vertex for every triangle. If a triangle shares one or more vertices, 
then that vertex is repeated, even if they share the same location and attributes.

For large models, there may be a significant percentage of shared vertices, and thus non-indexed geometry can be wasteful. 
Indexed geometry addresses this by keeping the positions and the topology separate.
