## Lights

### Directional Lights

> A light that gets emitted in a specific direction
> This light will behave as though it is infinitely far away and the rays produced from it are all parallel
> This light can cast shadows

### Hemisphere Lights

> A light source positioned directly above the scene, with color fading from the sky color to the ground color.
> This light cannot be used to cast shadows.

#### Roughness
> All the PBR techniques are based on the theory of microfacets. The theory describes that any surface at a microscopic 
scale can be described by tiny little perfectly reflective mirrors called microfacets. Depending on the roughness of a surface, 
the alignment of these tiny little mirrors can differ quite a lot

> The rougher a surface is, the more chaotically aligned each microfacet will be along the surface. 
The effect of these tiny-like mirror alignments is, that when specifically talking about specular lighting/reflection, 
the incoming light rays are more likely to scatter along completely different directions on rougher surfaces, 
resulting in a more widespread specular reflection. In contrast, on a smooth surface the light rays are more likely to 
reflect in roughly the same direction, giving us smaller and sharper reflections
 
#### Metalness

> Theoretically, the metalness of a material is binary: it's either a metal or it isn't; it can't be both. 
However, most render pipelines allow configuring the metalness of a surface linearly between 0.0 and 1.0. 
This is mostly because of the lack of material texture precision. For instance, a surface having 
small (non-metal) dust/sand-like particles/scratches over a metallic surface is difficult to 
render with binary metalness values.
