# P5 Javascript

When I was a master student in Georgia Tech in 2016, I attended the Computer Graphics course where
we used a software sketchbook software from https://processing.org/ and Java to do some artistic 
projects. 

Recently I decided to put some effort and try to rewrite some code by the Javascript platform
[p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js) so I can display them here 😏
