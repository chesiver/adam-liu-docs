### Good to Know
1. Chat we see in the phones are stored on the client itself
2. End to end encryptions should be done in client


### General Idea
The maximum limit of connections comes from the maximum number of file descriptors available to the process, most commonly.

There is little bottleneck from RAM or CPU for handling a large amount of concurrent connections

No P2P communication. All users are connected to chat servers.


### Protocal to Use

#### HTTP Pull

Send HTTP request with TTL.

- For every message, client will make a new request
- No persistent connection

#### HTTP Short Polling

Fire requests at a fixted interval (E.g. 0.1 second)

- Increase load of servers

#### HTTP Long Polling

Clients wait for server response a little longer (TTL is high)

- If user doesn't chat much, it will still make periodic connections

#### WebSocket

- Realtime, persistent connections
- Bi-directional FIFO communications
- HTTP Connection once for initial handshake, then it uses Websocket protocol to send / receive requests (FIFO)

### Message Storage

- Encode timestamp in message id
- SHarding on one conversation id (channel id)

### User Status

- Heartbeat from client to check if a user is online or not
- Publish / subscribe model to fanout online status
