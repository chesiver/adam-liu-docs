### Token Bucket

- A token bucket is a container that has pre-defined capacity.
- Tokens are put in the bucket at preset rates periodically.
- Once the bucket is full, no more tokens are added.
- The refiller puts 2 tokens into the bucket every second. Once the bucket is full, extra tokens will overflow


### Leaking Bucket

- When a request arrives, the system checks if the queue is full. If it is not full, the request is added to the queue.
- Otherwise, the request is dropped.
- Requests are pulled from the queue and processed at regular intervals.

Pros:
- Memory efficient given the limited queue size.
- Requests are processed at a fixed rate therefore it is suitable for use cases that a stable outflow rate is needed.

Cos:
- A burst of traffic fills up the queue with old requests, and if they are not processed in time, recent requests will be rate limited.
- There are two parameters in the algorithm. It might not be easy to tune them properly.

### Fixed-window Counter

- The algorithm divides the timeline into fix-sized time windows and assign a counter for each window.
- Each request increments the counter by one.
- Once the counter reaches the pre-defined threshold, new requests are dropped until a new time window starts.


Pros: Memory efficient, Easy to understand, Resetting available quota at the end of a unit time window fits certain use cases.

Cons: Spike in traffic at the edges of a window could cause more requests than the allowed quota to go through.

### Sliding-window Counter

Assume the rate limiter allows a maximum of 7 requests per minute, and there are 5 requests in the previous minute and 3 in the current minute. 
For a new request that arrives at a 30% position in the current minute, the number of requests in the rolling window is calculated using the 
following formula:

- Requests in current window + requests in the previous window * overlap percentage of the rolling window and previous window.
- Using this formula, we get 3 + 5 * 0.7% = 6.5 request. Depending on the use case, the number can either be rounded up or down.
