### Feed Service

- Add a precomputed feed table 
- If a user is following a large number of users, need large number of queries to the Post table to build feed
- If a user has a large number of followers, pre-calculation is very expensive
- Hybrid approach. Choose between fanout-read or fanout-write

### Post Service 

- Possible uneven reads to some popular posts
- User replicated post cache. Assume posts are rarely modified.
