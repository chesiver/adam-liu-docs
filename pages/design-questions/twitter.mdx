### Use Cases

- Tweet. Allow you to post text, image, video, links, etc
- Share. Allow you to share someone's tweets
- Follow && Timelines
- Search

### User Service

- Store all the user-related information in our system and provide endpoints for login, register
- Sits on top of a User DB which is a mysql database.

### User Graph Service

- The “follow” related requests will be serviced by a Graph Service, which sits on top of a graph database.
- Follow-links won't change too frequently, so it makes sense to cache this information in a Redis.

### Timeline Service (for Following)

- Precalculate the timeline of active users and cache it in a Redis. Notify followers 
- Don't do precalculation for too famous users

### Search && Analytics

- Ingest tweets into Elasticsearch
- Spark streaming to calculate trending keywords.

### Tweet Storage

NoSql MongoDB / Cassandra as the main database for its scalability and schema flexibility.  

Tweet, User, Hashtag, UserMentioned.

Take Hashtag is a separate document from Tweet document because the main functionality we want to implement efficiently 
is the mapping from hash tag to tweets.

User.number_of_likes would have a scalability challenge. Create a sharded counter service for users with more than, e.g., 1,000 followers
Once in a while (say every 5 minutes or so), the service would write the number_of_likes in Tweet document.

Expect creating and viewing would show strong locality. Shading by user ID seems reasonable.
