### Cache Strategies

- Write Around: When data is written, it is written directly to the database and not to the cache. 
The cache is only updated when data is read.
- Write Back (Write Behind): Data is first written to the cache and then, after a certain amount of time or under certain conditions, 
written back to the database.  This allows for batch updates.
- Write Through: Data is written simultaneously to the cache and the database. This ensures data consistency between the cache and database.

### Cache Eviction Policies

- Least Recently Used (LRU): Evicts the least recently accessed items first, assuming that items not accessed recently are less likely to 
be accessed in the future.
- Least Frequently Used (LFU): Prioritizes eviction of least frequently accessed items, assuming frequent access implies future relevance.

### Cache invalidation

- Time to Live (TTL): Data is invalidated after a specified duration.
    - Active expiration: A background process or thread periodically scans the cache to check the TTL of cache entries.
    - Passive expiration: Checks the TTL of a cache entry at its access time.
- Write-Invalidate: When data is updated in the primary storage, corresponding cache entries are invalidated.
- Change Notification: The cache listens for notifications from the data source about changes.
- Polling: The cache periodically checks the validity of its entries by comparing them with the source data.


### Key Distribution Model (Redis Cluster)

The cluster's key space is split into 16384 slots, effectively setting an upper limit for the cluster size of 16384 master nodes 
(however, the suggested max size of nodes is on the order of ~ 1000 nodes).

When the cluster is stable, a single hash slot will be served by a single node (however the serving node can have one or more replicas 
that will replace it in the case of net splits or failures, and that can be used in order to scale read operations where reading stale 
data is acceptable).

#### Hash Tag

Hash tags are a way to ensure that multiple keys are allocated in the same hash slot. 
This is used in order to implement multi-key operations in Redis Cluster.

If the key contains a `{ xxx }` pattern only the substring between `{` and `}` is hashed in order to obtain the hash slot.

### High Availability (Redis Sentinel)

Redis offers asynchronous primary->secondary replication. A single server is chosen as the primary, which can accept writes.
It relays its state changes to secondary servers, which follow along.

Redis has a system called Sentinel, which, when configured correctly, will try to establish a quorum between Sentinel nodes, 
agree on which Redis servers are alive, and promote any which appear to have failed. If we colocate the Sentinel nodes 
with the Redis nodes, this should allow us to promote a new primary in the majority component (should one exist).

##### Partition && Healing

Say we have 5 nodes. Partition nodes n1 and n2 away from n3, n4, and n5.

Even though n1 can't possibly be replicating its writes to n3, n4, and n5, writes against it are still completing successfully.
N1 still thinks it's the primary, and since replication is asynchronous/

When the network comes back online, Sentinel demotes the old primary when it comes back into contact with the majority component.

The design of Redis Sentinel (or, for that matter, any other failover system on top of an asynchronously replicated primary-secondary design)
means you can lose a lot of data when a partition occurs.
