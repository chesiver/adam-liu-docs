### Cache Strategies

- Write Around: When data is written, it is written directly to the database and not to the cache. 
The cache is only updated when data is read.
- Write Back (Write Behind): Data is first written to the cache and then, after a certain amount of time or under certain conditions, 
written back to the database.  This allows for batch updates.
- Write Through: Data is written simultaneously to the cache and the database. This ensures data consistency between the cache and database.

### Cache Eviction Policies

- Least Recently Used (LRU): Evicts the least recently accessed items first, assuming that items not accessed recently are less likely to 
be accessed in the future.
- Least Frequently Used (LFU): Prioritizes eviction of least frequently accessed items, assuming frequent access implies future relevance.

### Cache invalidation

- Time to Live (TTL): Data is invalidated after a specified duration.
    - Active expiration: A background process or thread periodically scans the cache to check the TTL of cache entries.
    - Passive expiration: Checks the TTL of a cache entry at its access time.
- Write-Invalidate: When data is updated in the primary storage, corresponding cache entries are invalidated.
- Change Notification: The cache listens for notifications from the data source about changes.
- Polling: The cache periodically checks the validity of its entries by comparing them with the source data.


### Key Distribution Model (Redis Cluster)

The cluster's key space is split into 16384 slots, effectively setting an upper limit for the cluster size of 16384 master nodes 
(however, the suggested max size of nodes is on the order of ~ 1000 nodes).

When the cluster is stable, a single hash slot will be served by a single node (however the serving node can have one or more replicas 
that will replace it in the case of net splits or failures, and that can be used in order to scale read operations where reading stale 
data is acceptable).

#### Hash Tag

Hash tags are a way to ensure that multiple keys are allocated in the same hash slot. 
This is used in order to implement multi-key operations in Redis Cluster.

If the key contains a `{ xxx }` pattern only the substring between `{` and `}` is hashed in order to obtain the hash slot.
