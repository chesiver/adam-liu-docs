## Vector-based recall

How to select 2000 - 3000 candidates from millions of items?

Basic idea: Encode users && items into multi-dimentioanl embeddings, then find Top-K closest 
neighbors to the user embedding in the multidimentional space.

## Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search

Trade off between accuracy and speed / space.

## NSW KNN Search

### Search

- limit: number of neighbors to search. Keep at most this number of elements in the result set.
- base_node: the search target.
- entry_points: the entry points.

```
C <- entry_points as min heap on distance
W <- entry_points as max heap on distance
visited <- entry_points as unordered set
while not C.empty():
    node <- pop C (nearest element in C)
    if dist(node) > dist(top W): # top W is the furthest element in W
        break
    for neighbor in neighbors of node:
        if not visited neighbor:
            visited += neighbor
            C += neighbor
            W += neighbor
            retain k-nearest elements in W
return W
```

### Insertion

Insertion follows the same process as layer search. We simply find the k-nearest neighbors 
of the to-be-inserted vector in a layer, and add edges from the inserting vector to 
the neighbors.

To cut down the conections, we simply re-compute the k-nearest neighbors of nodes
whose number of connections exceeds max_m parameter.

## Hierarchical-NSW

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.09320

HNSW adds layered structure to the NSW index, therefore making the search process faster. 
The idea is similar to the skiplist data structure.
The bottom-most level 0 NSW layer contains all information, 
and we randomly put some vectors to the upper layer (more upper layer has fewer elements), 
which are also NSW indexes. The search process starts from the upper-most layer, and uses 
neighbors in that layer as the entry points of the lower layer.

### Search

```
ep = upper-most level entry point
for go down one level until last level:
    ep <- layers[level].search(ep=ep, limit=1, search_target)
return layers[0].search(ep=ep, limit=limit, search_target)
```

### Insertion

<Image src="/images/recommendation/hnsw-insert.svg" width={400} height={150}/>

Before inserting, we will need to decide which layer and below levels to insert the vector. 
From the HNSW paper, this is computed by $$ level = -\ln{Unif([0, 1]) * m_L}$$

```
ep = upper-most level entry point
target_level = generate random level based on m_L
for go down one level until target_level + 1
    ep <- layers[level].search(ep=ep, limit=1, search_target)
for go down one level until level 0
    ep <- layers[level].search(ep=ep, limit=ef_construction, search_target)
    neighbors <- m-nearest neighbor in ep
    connect neighbors with search_target
    purge edges of neighbors if larger than m_max of that layer
```
