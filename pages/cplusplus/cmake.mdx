### Template Project for CMake && vcpkg

https://github.com/chesiver/vcpkg-cmake-template

Pin this at the top as combining CMake, vcpkg and VSCode CMake plugin really works great. 

Some people like not to use any package manager, but when importing very large library (Boost / Folly) with 
many 3rd-party libXXX dependencies, configuring the build env && process is tedious.

Just let a package manager deal with that.

### Raw CMake Template

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)

project(asmjit_test)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++17 -O3")

include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
    json
    URL https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/download/v3.11.3/json.tar.xz
)
FetchContent_Declare(
    spdlog
    URL https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/archive/refs/tags/v1.14.1.tar.gz
)
FetchContent_Declare(
    rapidjson
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson
    GIT_TAG        master
    CONFIGURE_COMMAND ""
    BUILD_COMMAND ""
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(json spdlog rapidjson)

add_compile_options(-fsanitize=address -g)
add_link_options(-fsanitize=address -g)

set(SOURCE_FILES main.cpp)
add_executable(test ${SOURCE_FILES})
target_link_libraries(test PRIVATE nlohmann_json::nlohmann_json spdlog::spdlog)
target_include_directories(test PRIVATE ${rapidjson_SOURCE_DIR}/include)
```

### FetchContent

When fetching dependencies from github, choosing to download released .tar files saves a lot of time.

If a library is header-only, we can skip configure / build by setting the commands to be empty.

If you are creating a shared library and your source cpp files #include the headers of another library (Say, QtNetwork for example), 
but your header files don't include QtNetwork headers, then QtNetwork is a PRIVATE dependency.

If your source files and your headers include the headers of another library, then it is a PUBLIC dependency.

If your header files other than your source files include the headers of another library, then it is an INTERFACE dependency.
