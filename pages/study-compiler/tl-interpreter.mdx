## Introduction of Tiny Language

After learning how to use write ANTLR grammar file to generate parser, the next question is what I can do by the parser. A simple 
calculator seems a little bit trivial, while a general-purpose language could be very difficult for someone as a beginner.

So after spending some time on searching, I found this repo really helpful for me to understand how to implement a interpreter 
for a extremely simple language with the generated ANTLR parser:

The tutorial blog together with language specification is hosted on https://web.archive.org/, which is a nonprofit org . I'm a little
worried it might dissappear at some point so I will copy some contents here.

Also the original implementation use ANTLR Java Target. But I would like to try Golang target.
