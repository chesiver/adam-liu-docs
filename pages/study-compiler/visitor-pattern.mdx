## Visitor Pattern

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern

> In object-oriented programming and software engineering, the visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm 
from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations 
to existing object structures without modifying the structures.

We also want to traverse an AST for many different purposes. We may want to print the AST, perform semantic analysis, 
or generate code. Each of these could be accomplished by refining the notion of tree traversal in extensions of some common superclass.

Thus, the actual work performed upon a node depends on two things: the node type and the traversal type.

The Visitor pattern was introduced to address the above scenario. Instead of spreading all the code for a given traversal 
throughout the nodes' classes, the code is concentrated in a particular traversal class. 
That code is called by arranging for each node to

1. Accept a call from a visitor that performs the traversal
2. Call the visitor back using a method in that visitor that is customized to the node

Let's suppose we wish to traverse our AST to print out its nodes. The traversal class is a particular kind of visitor, and 
it contains the following kind of code:

```java
public class PrintTraversal extends Visitor {
    public void visitStringNode(StringNode n) {....}
    public void visitIntNode   (IntNode n)    {....}
    public void visitSymbolNode(SymbolNode n) {....}
}
```

Each of the above methods knows how to print out its own particular kind of node.

Each node in turn accepts a call from a particular visitor:

```java
public class StringNode extends AbstractNode {
    pubic void accept(Visitor v) {  v.visitStringNode(this); }
}
public class IntNode extends AbstractNode {
    pubic void accept(Visitor v) {  v.visitIntNode(this); }
}
public class SymbolNode extends AbstractNode {
    pubic void accept(Visitor v) {  v.visitSymbolNode(this); }
}
```

Because the supplied visitor's actual type could be any subclass of Visitor, this implies that the superclass Visitor 
must have (potentially abstract) methods.

```java
public abstract class Visitor {
    public abstract void visitStringNode(StringNode n) ;
    public abstract void visitIntNode   (IntNode n)    ;
    public abstract void visitSymbolNode(SymbolNode n) ;
}
```
