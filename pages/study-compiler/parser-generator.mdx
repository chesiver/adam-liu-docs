# Antlr

[Antlr](https://www.antlr.org/) is a powerful parser generator. 

I didn't attend compilor theory courses when I was a student. I regret missing the opportunity at that time and I decide to 
enrich my knowledge about parsing now. 

Antlr is designed to be an easy-to-use tool so I choose it to be my starting point.

## Parse Tree Visualization (Javascript)

Antlr has a collection of widely-used programmings languages, by which Javascript is certainly included.

[Javascript Grammar](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/javascript/javascript)

From the grammar, we can easily generate parsers in javascript and thus we are able to run the parsing tree generation 
in browser :)
