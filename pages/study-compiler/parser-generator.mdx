## Parse Tree && Abstract Syntax Tree

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5026517/whats-the-difference-between-parse-trees-and-abstract-syntax-trees-asts

> The parse tree is a concrete representation of the input. The parse tree retains all of the information of the input. 
The empty boxes represent whitespace, i.e. end of line.

> ASTs represent the syntactic structure of the some code. The trees of programming constructs such as expressions, 
flow control statements, etc - grouped into operators (interior nodes) and operands (leaves)

> ASTs don't deal with grammars and string generation, but programming constructs, and thus they represent relationships 
between such constructs, and not the ways they are generated by a gramma

> What goes into the AST is more of a personal preference but must contain enough info to accomplish the task.

## AST Explorer

Someone already made a very good tool for exploring AST(abstract syntax tree) of many languages, parsed 
by a bunch of different parsers, with good tree visualization and hightlighting:

## Antlr

I feel like manually writing parsers is extremely tedious for me so I would like to try some parser generators.

[Antlr](https://www.antlr.org/) is a powerful parser generator. 

Antlr is designed to be an easy-to-use tool so I choose it to be my starting point.

Antlr generates a parse tree. We need to convert it to a AST by ourself.

## Parse Tree Visualization (Javascript)

Antlr has a collection of widely-used programmings languages, by which Javascript is certainly included.

[Javascript Grammar](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/javascript/javascript)

From the grammar, we can easily generate parsers in javascript/typescript and thus we are able to run the parsing tree generation 
in browser :)
