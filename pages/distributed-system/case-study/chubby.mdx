## Intro

Chubby is a service that provides a distributed locking mechanism and also
stores small files. Internally, it is implemented as a key/value store that also
provides a locking mechanism on each object stored in it. 

Apache ZooKeeper is the opensource alternative to Chubby.

Chubby actually uses Paxos underneath to manage the state of the Chubby system at any
point in time.

## Use Cases

- Leader/master election: Any lock service can be seen as a consensus service, as it converts the
problem of reaching consensus to handing out locks. Basically, a set of
distributed applications compete to acquire a lock, and whoever gets the lock
first gets the resource.
- Naming service (like DNS): It is hard to make faster updates to DNS due to its time-based caching nature,
which means there is generally a potential delay before the latest DNS
mapping is effective. As a result, chubby has replaced DNS inside Google as
the main way to discover servers.
- Storage (small objects that rarely change): Chubby provides a Unix-style interface to reliably store small files that do
not change frequently (complementing the service offered by GFS).
Applications can then use these files for any usage like DNS, configs, etc.
- Distributed locking mechanism: Chubby provides a developer-friendly interface for coarse-grained
distributed locks (as opposed to fine-grained locks). In other words,
we can say that Chubby provides mechanisms like semaphores and mutexes
for a distributed environment.

## Key Concepts Summary

### Chubby Cell

A Chubby Cell basically refers to a Chubby cluster. A chubby cell consists of a small set of servers (typically 5) known as
replicas. Using Paxos, one of the servers is chosen as the master who handles all
client requests. Each replica maintains a small database to store files/directories/locks.
The master writes directly to its own local database, which gets synced
asynchronously to all the replicas. 


### Client Library && API

Client applications use a Chubby library to communicate with the replicas in
the chubby cell using RPC.

Chubby exports a file system interface similar to POSIX but simpler. It
consists of a strict tree of files and directories in the usual way, with name
components separated by slashes.

File format: /ls/chubby_cell/directory_name/.../file_name


### Why was Chubby Built as a Service?

- Development becomes easy
- Lock-based interface is developer-friendly
- Provide quorum & replica management
- Broadcast functionality


### Advisory Locks

Chubby locks are advisory, which means it is up to the application to honor
the lock. Chubby doesn't make locked objects inaccessible to clients not
holding their locks. It is more like record keeping and allows the lock
requester to discover that lock is held.


### Server Initialization

- A master is chosen among Chubby replicas using Paxos.
- Current master information is persisted in storage, and all replicas
become aware of the master.

### Client Initialization

- Client contacts the DNS to know the listed Chubby replicas.
- Client calls any Chubby server directly via Remote Procedure Call (RPC).
- If that replica is not the master, it will return the address of the current
master.
- Once the master is located, the client maintains a session with it and
sends all requests to it until it indicates that it is not the master anymore
or stops responding.

### Locks

Each chubby node can act as a reader-writer lock in one of the following two
way.

- Exclusive: One client may hold the lock in exclusive (write) mode.
- Shared: Any number of clients may hold the lock in shared (reader)
mode.

### Sequencer

Sequencer = Name of the lock + Lock mode (exclusive or shared) + Lock generation number

An application's master server can generate a sequencer and send it with
any internal order to other servers. Application servers that receive orders
from a primary can check with Chubby if the sequencer is still good and does
not belong to a stale primary.

### Session 

A Chubby session is a relationship between a Chubby cell and a Chubby
client.

- It exists for some interval of time and is maintained by periodic
handshakes called KeepAlives.
- Client's handles, locks, and cached data only remain valid provided its
session remains valid.

### KeepAlive

KeepAlive is basically a way for a client to maintain a constant session with
Chubby cell. 

### Events

Chubby supports a simple event mechanism to let its clients subscribe to a
variety of events. Events are delivered to the client asynchronously via
callbacks from the Chubby library. Clients subscribe to a range of events
while creating a handle. Here are examples of such events:

- File contents modified
- Child node added, removed, or modified
- Chubby master failed over
- A handle (and its lock) has become invalid.
- Lock acquired
- Conflicting lock request from another client

### Cache

To reduce read traffic, Chubby clients cache file
contents, node metadata, and information on open handles in a consistent,
write-through cache in the client's memory. Because of this caching, Chubby
must maintain consistency between a file and a cache as well as between the
different replicas of the file. Chubby clients maintain their cache by a lease
mechanism and flush the cache when the lease expires.
