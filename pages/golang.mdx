## Useful Golang Concept

I feel like nothing is more accurate than golang's official spec, but reading the whole spec doc 
could be really time-consuming.
So I quote some important concepts here which I think would be crucial for understanding golang's 
type system and generics.

### [Types](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Types)

**Type set** of interface types

> An interface type defines a type set. A variable of interface type can store a value of any type that is in the type set of the interface

> In its most basic form an interface specifies a (possibly empty) list of methods. 
The type set defined by such an interface is the set of types which implement all of those methods, 
and the corresponding method set consists exactly of the methods specified by the interface

> In a slightly more general form an interface T may use a (possibly qualified) interface type name E as an interface element

> The type set of T is the intersection of the type sets defined by T's explicitly declared methods and the type sets of T’s embedded interfaces

**Implementing** an interface

> A type T implements an interface I if
> - T is not an interface and is an element of the type set of I; or
> - T is an interface and the type set of T is a subset of the type set of I. 

### [Properties of types and values](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Properties_of_types_and_values)

**Underlying types**

> Each type T has an underlying type: If T is one of the predeclared boolean, numeric, or string types, or a type literal, 
the corresponding underlying type is T itself. 
>
> Otherwise, T's underlying type is the underlying type of the type to which T refers in its declaration. 
For a type parameter that is the underlying type of its type constraint, which is always an interface.

**Core types**

> An interface T has a core type if one of the following conditions is satisfied:
>
> 1. There is a single type U which is the underlying type of all types in the type set of T; or
> 2. the type set of T contains only channel types with identical element type E, and all directional channels have the same direction.


### [Constants](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Constants)

> Constants may be typed or untyped. Literal constants, true, false, iota, and certain constant expressions containing 
only untyped constant operands are untyped.

```go
const a = 2 + 3.0          // a == 5.0   (untyped floating-point constant)
const b = 15 / 4           // b == 3     (untyped integer constant)
const c = 15 / 4.0         // c == 3.75  (untyped floating-point constant)
const Θ float64 = 3/2      // Θ == 1.0   (type float64, 3/2 is integer division)
const Π float64 = 3/2.     // Π == 1.5   (type float64, 3/2. is float division)
const d = 1 << 3.0         // d == 8     (untyped integer constant)
const e = 1.0 << 3         // e == 8     (untyped integer constant)
const f = int32(1) << 33   // illegal    (constant 8589934592 overflows int32)
const g = float64(2) >> 1  // illegal    (float64(2) is a typed floating-point constant)
const h = "foo" > "bar"    // h == true  (untyped boolean constant)
const j = true             // j == true  (untyped boolean constant)
const k = 'w' + 1          // k == 'x'   (untyped rune constant)
const l = "hi"             // l == "hi"  (untyped string constant)
const m = string(k)        // m == "x"   (type string)
const Σ = 1 - 0.707i       //            (untyped complex constant)
const Δ = Σ + 2.0e-4       //            (untyped complex constant)
const Φ = iota*1i - 1/1i   //            (untyped complex constant)
```


### Generics

#### [Type Instantiations](https://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Instantiations)

{/* [Generic types must be instantiated when they are used](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71282839) */}

```
type parameter list    type arguments    after substitution

[P any]                int               int satisfies any
[S ~[]E, E any]        []int, int        []int satisfies ~[]int, int satisfies any
[P io.Writer]          string            illegal: string doesn't satisfy io.Writer
[P comparable]         any               any satisfies (but does not implement) comparable
```

#### [Type Inference](https://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Type_inference)


> 1. apply function argument type inference to all typed ordinary function arguments
> 2. apply constraint type inference
> 3. apply function argument type inference to all untyped ordinary function arguments using the default type for each of the untyped function arguments
> 4. apply constraint type inference

**Type Unification**

> Unification works by comparing the structure of pairs of types: their structure disregarding type parameters must be identical, and types other than type parameters must be equivalent

> If T1 and T2 are type parameters, []map[int]bool can be unified with any of the following:

```
[]map[int]bool   // types are identical
T1               // adds T1 → []map[int]bool to substitution map
[]T1             // adds T1 → map[int]bool to substitution map
[]map[T1]T2      // adds T1 → int and T2 → bool to substitution map
```

> []map[int]bool cannot be unified with any of

```
int              // int is not a slice
struct{}         // a struct is not a slice
[]struct{}       // a struct is not a map
[]map[T1]string  // map element types don't match
```

**Function argument type inference**

> Function argument type inference infers type arguments from function arguments: 
if a function parameter is declared with a type T that uses type parameters, 
unifying the type of the corresponding function argument with T may infer type arguments 
for the type parameters used by T.

**Constraint type inference**

> If a type parameter P has a constraint with a core type C, unifying P with C may infer additional type arguments, 
either the type argument for P, or if that is already known, possibly the type arguments for type parameters used in C


#### Examples - Error when instantiate with empty-type-set interface constraint

Sort of related https://github.com/golang/go/issues/51470

> Implementation restriction: A compiler need not report an error if an operand's type is a type parameter 
with an empty type set. Functions with such type parameters cannot be instantiated; 
any attempt will lead to an error at the instantiation site.

```go copy
package main

type X interface {
	Required()
}

type A1 struct{}

type A2 struct{}

func (*A2) Required() {}

// This might result in interface with empty type set
type B[U any] interface {
	X
	*U
}

type C[T B[U], U any] struct {
}

func CreateC[T B[U], U any](_ *U) *C[T, U] {
	return &C[T, U]{}
}

func main() {
	// CreateC(&A1{}) // will cause failure
	CreateC(&A2{})
}

### Reflection

#### Basic

Get Type/Kind/Value from a interface value

```go copy
var x interface{} = 3.4
v := reflect.ValueOf(x)
fmt.Println("type:", v.Type())
fmt.Println("kind is float64:", v.Kind() == reflect.Float64)
fmt.Println("value:", v.Float())
```

```console
type: float64
kind is float64: true
value: 3.4  
```

Set Value for a interface value whose underlying type is a pointer
```go copy
var x float64 = 3.4
p := reflect.ValueOf(&x)
v := p.Elem()
fmt.Printf("x: %v\n", x)
fmt.Printf("CanSet: %v\n", v.CanSet())
v.SetFloat(7.1)
fmt.Printf("x: %v\n", x)
```

```console
x: 3.4
CanSet: true
x: 7.1 
```
